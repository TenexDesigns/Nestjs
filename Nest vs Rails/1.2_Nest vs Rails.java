Nest.js and Rails are both popular frameworks for developing web applications. However, Nest.js is generally considered to be a better choice for larger and more complex applications, especially monolith and microservices applications.

Here are some of the features and advantages that make Nest.js a good choice for large and complex applications:

* **Modularity:** Nest.js is a highly modular framework. This makes it easy to develop and maintain large and complex applications, as each module can be developed and maintained independently.
* **Scalability:** Nest.js is very scalable. It can handle a large number of users and requests without any performance issues.
* **Performance:** Nest.js is very performant. This is because it is built on top of Node.js, which is a very fast and efficient runtime.
* **TypeScript support:** Nest.js supports TypeScript. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds type safety and other features.
* **Community support:** Nest.js has a large and active community. This means that there are many resources available for Nest.js developers, such as tutorials, articles, and libraries.

**Here is a comparison of Nest.js and Rails on some key features:**

| Feature | Nest.js | Rails |
|---|---|---|
| Modularity | Highly modular | Somewhat modular |
| Scalability | Very scalable | Good scalability |
| Performance | Very performant | Good performance |
| TypeScript support | Yes | No |
| Community support | Large and active | Large and active |

**Here are some specific features that make Nest.js a good choice for monolith and microservices applications:**

* **Dependency injection:** Nest.js has built-in support for dependency injection. This makes it easy to develop decoupled and maintainable code.
* **Event-driven architecture:** Nest.js supports event-driven architecture. This makes it easy to develop scalable and resilient applications.
* **API development:** Nest.js is well-suited for developing APIs. It provides a number of features that make it easy to develop and maintain APIs, such as RESTful routing, OpenAPI integration, and validation.

**In contrast, Rails is a more convention-over-configuration framework.** This means that Rails developers are expected to follow a specific way of doing things. This can make it difficult to learn and use Rails for large and complex applications.

**Conclusion**

If you are looking for a framework for developing large and complex applications, especially monolith and microservices applications, then Nest.js is a good choice. Nest.js is a highly modular, scalable, and performant framework that supports TypeScript and has a large and active community.
