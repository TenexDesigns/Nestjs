Nest.js does not have a built-in ORM or migration tool. However, there are a number of third-party ORMs and migration tools that can be used with Nest.js.

Some of the most popular ORMs for Nest.js include:

* TypeORM: A TypeScript ORM that supports a number of different database systems, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.
* Prisma: A next-generation ORM that supports a number of different database systems, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB.
* Sequelize: A Node.js ORM that supports a number of different database systems, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

Some of the most popular migration tools for Nest.js include:

* TypeORM CLI: A command-line tool for managing TypeORM migrations.
* Prisma Migrate: A command-line tool for managing Prisma migrations.
* Sequelize CLI: A command-line tool for managing Sequelize migrations.

Nest.js also does not have a built-in model validation or authentication system. However, there are a number of third-party libraries that can be used for model validation and authentication in Nest.js.

Some of the most popular model validation libraries for Nest.js include:

* Class-Validator: A TypeScript library for validating classes and objects.
* Express-Validator: A middleware for Express.js that provides validation for request and response bodies.
* Yup: A JavaScript library for validating objects and arrays.

Some of the most popular authentication libraries for Nest.js include:

* Passport: A Node.js authentication middleware that supports a number of different authentication strategies, such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, and SAML.
* JWT: A Node.js library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
* Nestjs Auth: A Nest.js library that provides a number of authentication features, such as user registration, login, and logout.

**Example:**

```typescript
import { Controller, Get, Request } from '@nestjs/common';
import { ClassSerializerInterceptor, UseInterceptors } from '@nestjs/common/interceptors';
import { ApiModelProperty } from '@nestjs/swagger';
import { Transform } from 'class-transformer';
import { IsEmail, IsString } from 'class-validator';
import { AuthService } from './auth.service';

export class LoginDTO {
  @IsEmail()
  email: string;

  @IsString()
  password: string;
}

@Controller('auth')
export class AuthController {
  constructor(private readonly authService: AuthService) {}

  @UseInterceptors(ClassSerializerInterceptor)
  @Post('login')
  async login(@Request() req: any) {
    const loginDTO: LoginDTO = req.body;
    const token = await this.authService.login(loginDTO);
    return { token };
  }
}
```

This example shows how to use Nest.js, Class-Validator, and Passport to create a simple authentication API.

**Conclusion**

Nest.js does not have a built-in ORM, migration tool, model validation system, or authentication system. However, there are a number of third-party libraries that can be used for these tasks.

In general, it is recommended to use third-party libraries for ORMs, migrations, model validation, and authentication in Nest.js. This is because these libraries are typically well-maintained and provide a lot of features.
