NestJS is a great framework for building GraphQL APIs. It provides built-in support for integrating GraphQL into your application using the `@nestjs/graphql` package.

To get started with NestJS and GraphQL, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: First, you need to install the required dependencies. Run the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   npm install --save @nestjs/graphql apollo-server-express graphql-tools graphql
   ```

2. **Create a GraphQL Module**: Next, you'll create a GraphQL module in your NestJS application. This module will handle the GraphQL schema, resolvers, and other related configurations. Run the following command to generate a new module:

   ```bash
   nest generate module graphql
   ```

3. **Create a GraphQL Resolver**: Inside the GraphQL module, you'll create a resolver that defines the GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions. Run the following command to generate a new resolver:

   ```bash
   nest generate resolver graphql
   ```

   This will generate a resolver file where you can define your GraphQL resolvers.

4. **Define GraphQL Schema**: In the resolver file, you'll define the GraphQL schema using the `@Resolver()` and `@Query()` decorators. You can also use the `@Mutation()` and `@Subscription()` decorators for mutations and subscriptions, respectively. Here's an example of a simple GraphQL resolver:

   ```typescript
   import { Resolver, Query } from '@nestjs/graphql';

   @Resolver()
   export class GraphQLResolver {
     @Query(() => String)
     hello(): string {
       return 'Hello, World!';
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Configure the GraphQL Module**: In the GraphQL module, you'll need to configure the GraphQL endpoint and other options. Here's an example of how you can configure the GraphQL module:

   ```typescript
   import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
   import { GraphQLModule } from '@nestjs/graphql';
   import { GraphQLResolver } from './graphql.resolver';

   @Module({
     imports: [
       GraphQLModule.forRoot({
         autoSchemaFile: true,
       }),
     ],
     providers: [GraphQLResolver],
   })
   export class GraphQLModule {}
   ```

   In this example, `autoSchemaFile: true` tells NestJS to automatically generate the GraphQL schema based on the resolvers.

6. **Bootstrap the Application**: Finally, you'll need to bootstrap your NestJS application and start the server. In your `main.ts` file, add the following code:

   ```typescript
   import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
   import { AppModule } from './app.module';
   import { ValidationPipe } from '@nestjs/common';

   async function bootstrap() {
     const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
     app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe());
     await app.listen(3000);
   }
   bootstrap();
   ```

   This code creates the NestJS application and starts the server on port 3000.

That's it! You've now set up a basic NestJS application with GraphQL integration. You can define more queries, mutations, and subscriptions in your resolver and build a complete GraphQL API.

Remember to import the necessary decorators and modules from `@nestjs/graphql` to use GraphQL features in your application.

For more advanced features and configurations, you can refer to the official NestJS documentation on GraphQL: [NestJS GraphQL](https://docs.nestjs.com/graphql/introduction).
                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                               ..
